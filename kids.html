	CP2H is a volunteer, not for profit organization, and welcomes referrals for donated medical and surgical services for children with surgical conditions not able to be treated in their home country. All referrals/requests for services will be initially screened by a CP2H representative and an initial response provided within 2 weeks to the referring person/agency.
	</p>
	<p>
	For Children accepted to CP2H for care, every effort is made to provide the safest, highest quality of care and service. Our all-volunteer Board of Directors reviews the cases to determine if they meet criteria for our program and services. We do this based on the information and medical records we have available to us at the time of the referral. Once a child has been identified as meeting our criteria, we provide:
	</p>
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	<ul>
	<li>Donated Medical care</li>
	<li>Emotional, medical and cultural support</li>
	<li>The identification of resources</li>
	<li>Academic, emotional &amp; medical education.</li>
	</ul>
	</blockquote>
